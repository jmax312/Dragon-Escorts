## Dragon Escorts

This app allows the viewer to have three 3D dragon escorts follow their face across the screen. The model used in this app was made by the coder, Joni. Its design was based off the character, Toothless, from the Dreamworks movie franchise, *How to Train Your Dragon.*

To run the program, play on any device that has a webcam. When the camera sees a full, front face, three dragons will appear around it and follow the face around. The program cannot track faces that are turned to the side or tilted too far down or up.
